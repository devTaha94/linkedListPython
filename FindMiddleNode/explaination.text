For this example, let's consider a linked list with the nodes:
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5.



Method Walkthrough: find_middle_node

def find_middle_node(self):


1. Initialize two pointers, slow and fast:

slow = self.head
fast = self.head
Here, both pointers start at the head of the linked list. The idea is that slow will move one node at a time, while fast will move two nodes. By the time fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle.



2. Traverse the linked list:

while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
This loop ensures that we continue as long as fast and the node after fast (fast.next) are not None. The two conditions are vital:

The first, fast is not None, ensures that we haven't already reached the end of the list.

The second, fast.next is not None, makes sure there's another node to move to, given that fast will be jumping two nodes in the next step. This prevents potential errors.

This will allow us to find the middle node when there is an even or odd number of nodes.



3. Move the slow pointer one node and the fast pointer two nodes:

    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next


For each iteration of the loop, the slow pointer moves one step (or one node) and the fast pointer moves two steps (or two nodes).



Illustrative Steps for 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5:

Both slow and fast start at node 1.

After the first iteration, slow moves to node 2, and fast moves to node 3.

In the second iteration, slow moves to node 3, and fast jumps to node 5.

On the next attempt to iterate, since fast.next is None (there's no node after node 5), the loop stops.

The slow pointer is now pointing to node 3, which is the middle of our list.



4. Return the node the slow pointer is currently at:

return slow


Once the loop exits, the slow pointer is either pointing to the middle node of the list (for odd-length lists) or the first of the two middle nodes (for even-length lists).



Conclusion: The find_middle_node method efficiently locates the middle of a linked list by using a two-pointer technique. The slow pointer moves at half the speed of the fast pointer. By the time the fast pointer has traveled the full length of the list, the slow pointer has traveled half the length, landing it in the middle. In our example, the middle of 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 is node 3, and the method will return this node.





Code with inline comments:



def find_middle_node(self):
    # 1. Initialize two pointers: 'slow' and 'fast', 
    # both starting from the head.
    slow = self.head
    fast = self.head
 
    # 2. Iterate as long as 'fast' pointer and its next 
    # node are not None.
    # This ensures we don't get an error trying to access
    # a non-existent node.
    while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
        
        # 2.1. Move 'slow' one step ahead.
        # This covers half the distance that 'fast' covers.
        slow = slow.next
        
        # 2.2. Move 'fast' two steps ahead.
        # Thus, when 'fast' reaches the end, 'slow' 
        # will be at the middle.
        fast = fast.next.next
 
    # 3. By now, 'fast' has reached or surpassed the end, 
    # and 'slow' is positioned at the middle node.
    # Return the 'slow' pointer, which points to 
    # the middle node.
    return slow
