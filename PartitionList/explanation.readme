 This function is designed to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes with values less than x come before nodes with values greater than or equal to x.

Consider a sample linked list and value for partitioning:

List: 5 → 3 → 8 → 2 → 10 → 4 → 1
Partition Value (x): 4
After partitioning, the linked list should look like:

3 → 2 → 1 → 5 → 8 → 10 → 4


Method Walkthrough:

def partition_list(self, x):


Check if the list is empty:

if not self.head:
    return None
If the list is empty, there's nothing to partition, so we return None.



Initialize two dummy nodes and corresponding pointers:

dummy1 = Node(0)
dummy2 = Node(0)
prev1 = dummy1
prev2 = dummy2
We are going to use two separate linked lists: one for values less than x (handled by dummy1 and prev1) and another for values greater than or equal to x (handled by dummy2 and prev2).



Start at the head of the original list:

current = self.head
This current pointer will help us traverse the original linked list.



Traverse the list and partition the nodes:

while current:
    if current.value < x:
        prev1.next = current
        prev1 = current
    else:
        prev2.next = current
        prev2 = current
    current = current.next
We use a loop to traverse the entire linked list. For each node, if its value is less than x, we append it to the list headed by dummy1. If it's greater than or equal to x, we append it to the list headed by dummy2.



Terminate both lists:

prev1.next = None
prev2.next = None
Since we've possibly moved some nodes from the original list to our two new lists, we need to ensure that both new lists are properly terminated by setting their last node's next pointers to None.



Connect the two lists:

prev1.next = dummy2.next
We attach the start of the second list (i.e., the list of values greater than or equal to x) to the end of the first list.



Update the head of the linked list:

self.head = dummy1.next


We update the head of the original list to point to the head of our partitioned list (i.e., the first node with a value less than x).



Conclusion: The partition_list method efficiently partitions a linked list around a value x by using two temporary linked lists: one for nodes with values less than x and another for nodes with values greater than or equal to x. After partitioning, it connects these two lists together and updates the original list's head to reflect the newly partitioned list. In our example, the linked list gets rearranged to have all nodes less than 4 come before nodes with values greater than or equal to 4.





Code with inline comments:



def partition_list(self, x):
    # 1. Edge case: Check if the list is empty. If so, exit.
    if not self.head:
        return None
 
    # 2. Create two dummy nodes: 
    # dummy1 for nodes with values less than x 
    # and dummy2 for nodes with values greater or equal to x.
    dummy1 = Node(0)
    dummy2 = Node(0)
 
    # 3. Initialize two pointers (prev1 and prev2) at the dummy nodes.
    # They will be used to build the two separate lists.
    prev1 = dummy1
    prev2 = dummy2
 
    # 4. Start iterating from the head of the original list.
    current = self.head
 
    # 5. Traverse the entire list.
    while current:
        # 5.1. If the current node's value is less than x:
        if current.value < x:
            # 5.1.1. Attach it to the end of the list starting at dummy1.
            prev1.next = current
            # 5.1.2. Move the prev1 pointer forward.
            prev1 = current
        # 5.2. Otherwise:
        else:
            # 5.2.1. Attach it to the end of the list starting at dummy2.
            prev2.next = current
            # 5.2.2. Move the prev2 pointer forward.
            prev2 = current
        
        # 5.3. Move to the next node in the original list.
        current = current.next
 
    # 6. End the two lists. Set the next pointers of prev1 and prev2 to None.
    prev1.next = None
    prev2.next = None
 
    # 7. Link the end of the first list (the one that started at dummy1) 
    # to the beginning of the second list (the one that started at dummy2).
    prev1.next = dummy2.next
 
    # 8. Update the head of the linked list to point to the beginning 
    # of the partitioned list.
    self.head = dummy1.next
